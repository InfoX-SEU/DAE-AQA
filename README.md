## Datasets
MTL-AQA dataset was orignially presented in the paper __What and How Well You Performed? A Multitask Learning Approach to Action Quality Assessment__ (CVPR 2019) \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04346)\], where the authors provided the YouTube links of untrimmed long videos and the corresponding annotations at [here](https://github.com/ParitoshParmar/MTL-AQA/tree/master/MTL-AQA_dataset_release). The processed MTL-AQA dataset(Frames) can be downloaded through the following links:

1.[[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/)]

2.[[Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1-EH7Q0LtaDCicateuT9mFg)](Password:SEU1)

The whole data structure should be:
```
DAE_AQA
├── data
|  └── frames
|  └── info
...
```
#### JIGSAWS dataset
JIGSAWS dataset was presented in the paper __Jhu-isi gesture and skill assessment working set (jigsaws): A surgical activity dataset for human motion modeling__ (MICCAI workshop 2014), where the raw videos could be downloaded at [here](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/research/hmm/datasets/jigsaws_release/). We're typographing this part of the code, and we'll release it soon. The whole data structure is same as MTL-AQA. The processed JIGSAWS dataset(Frames) can be downloaded through the following links:

## Training

training DAE model:
~~~shell
$ python DAE.py
~~~

training DAE-MT model:
~~~shell
$ python DAE-MT.py
~~~

All parameters are set in config.py. Considering that the memory of video processing on GPU is quite large, we suggest using small batch for training.qwq

## Testing

We provided a pre-trained DAE-MT model weight with a correlation coefficient of 0.9449 on MTL-AQA test dataset. You can download it through the following links:
